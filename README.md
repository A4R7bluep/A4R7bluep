My name is Yuuki Gibson. I am currently a Freshman at UMass Lowell. I am majoring in Computer Science. I like to work on my various Godot projects. I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript,  Python, and C. I have made projects in C# with ASP.NET and WinForms in the past. I am currently working on a game with my friend in our organization [Steel Demon Games](https://github.com/Steel-Demon-Games). And slowly working on my game, [Project Gearish](https://github.com/A4R7bluep/Smashish3), in the background. I am also finishing Beta on my [AzriaEditor](https://github.com/A4R7bluep/AzriaEditor), my code editor, made to help me be more efficient during class.
