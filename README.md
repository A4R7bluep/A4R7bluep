My name is Ross Gibson. I am currently a Junior at Assabet Valley Regional Technical High School. I am in the Computer Programming and Web Development shop. I enjoy programming. I know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I am currently trying to get better at C# and using Microsoft's .NET Framework. I have used WinForms and ASP.NET.
